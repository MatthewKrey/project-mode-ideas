## Background

In terms of what projects are cool, we tend to think the nature of value in software lies in being able to answer or automate a question that was previously difficult.

For example, AirBnB answers the question "Who's couch can I crash on tonight?" and, "How can my guest bedroom/couch earn me extra cash?". Meanwhilte, Kickstarter answers the questions "Where can I get money for an art project?" and "Which independent projects can I support?". 

Every feature of your applicationshould answer a question. For instance, an application you could build might answer, "Who is committing code at Flatiron School right now?", "Who wants to meet for tutoring this weekend?". Focus on questions, on problems, then solve them with code. Your application should answer at most 2-3 fundemental questions.

## Ideas

Remember, every project should answer a question or solve a problem. Please read the background section first before brainstorming.

### Curating-Focused
* Wake Up Morning Texts / Email
  * A morning text/email with what you need to do know for today.
* Increase Your Twitter Following
  * Pretty much, you would be building a free version of [Refollow](http://re-follow.com/).
  * Based on content of a user's tweets and the people who already follow that user, this software would recommend other Twitter uses for the user to follow who would be more likely to follow back. 
  * It would also suggest a list of users to unfollow because they're not following back.
  * Finally, it would suggest a list of users to unfollow because they're following and tend to continue following, whether or whether not the users they follow follow-back.
* Scrapebook CMS
  * Create a scrapebook timecapsule where you create a vignette of data and get it emailed to you.
* Seasonal Ingredient Recipe Suggestor
  * Self-explanatory 

### Data Visualization

* Maps that show social program enrollment data, such as [Slate's article on food stamps](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/map_of_the_week/2013/04/food_stamp_recipients_by_county_an_interactive_tool_showing_local_snap_data.html) and [D3 visualization of food stamps by state](http://bl.ocks.org/NPashaP/a74faf20b492ad377312). For some D3 inspiration, take a look at [some examples](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery).
* Map that shows school statistics, such as SAT score, funding, dropout rates, etc. by country/state/county/etc.

### Developer-Specific

* Gitabarotors
  * Show via commits who and through what projects you've worked on with people.
* Big O calculutor
  * Read more about Big-O Notation [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation).
* Hack Hacker News
  * Analyze which users on Hacker News are the most popular
* Visualization of who is committing code around the world
  * Along the lines of [GitHubBub](http://githubbub.com/).

### Flatiron Software

* Flatiron GitHub Pull Request Solari Dashboard via GitHub API hooks
  * See Fog Creek's example [here](https://github.com/FogCreek/solari-board)
  * Would display on TV screens for subsequent semesters.
* Flatiron Magazine
  * Improve upon the current version of [Flatiron's Blog Magazine](http://magazine.flatironschool.com/)
* Flatiron Eats
  * Using the Yelp and Google Maps APIs allow the user to curate lists from Yelp.
  * Somehow have modal where the pin on the map would link to the Yelp link.
  * Incorporate comments from fellow students and teachers.
  * Would be hosted at `eat.flatironschool.com`.
* Match Volunteer Tutors to Students
  * Uses locations, skill levels, preferences, availability to match tutors with students.
  * Could take the place of Elana's current weekend Google Drive spreadsheet system.

### Logistics
* Food Truck Tracker
  * Based on foodtruck twitters, or other info, map foodtrucks.
* On My Way Too...
  * Find X type of place near a route.

### Social Impact
* Matching Volunteer Tutors to Students
  * Uses locations, skill levels, preferences, availability to match tutors with students.
  * Could take the place of Elana's current weekend Google Drive spreadsheet system.

### Advertising / Marketing / Split Testing

* Find the Best Image
  * Basically like OkCupid's My Best Face - but imagine you want to choose an image for your website, which is best? Split test it. Inspired by: 
    
      I wish there was OKCupid's My Best Face for business. I have a stack of #MuseumHack tour images, want to know which       one is liked best.
   

## Data

There are many places to find data. There are APIs, open data from the government and other agencies/organizations, private APIs you can look into discovering (read up [here](http://hungtran.co/discovering-tinders-private-api/)), plus random spreadsheets and tables scattered throughout the web. Below are a few of our favorites.
