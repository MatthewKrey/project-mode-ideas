# Web Development Project Mode Ideas

## Background
In terms of what projects are cool, we tend to think the nature of value in software lies in being able to answer or automate a question that was previously difficult. For example, Airbnb answers the questions "Who's couch can I crash on tonight?", Kickstarter "Where can I get money for an art project?" (or conversely, "Which independent projects can I support?"). Your application—every feature—should answer a person's question. For instance, an application you could build might answer, "Who is committing code at Flatiron School right now?", "Who wants to meet for tutoring this weekend?". Focus on questions, on problems, then solve them with code. Your application should answer at most 2-3 fundemental questions.

## Social Impact
* Matching Volunteer Tutors to Students
  * Uses locations, skill levels, preferences, availability to match tutors with students.
  * Could take the place of Elana's current weekend Google Drive spreadsheet system.

## Curating-Focused
* Wake Up Morning Texts / Email
  * A morning text/email with what you need to do know for today.
* Increase Your Twitter Following
  * Based on content of a user's tweets and the people who already follow that user, this software would recommend other Twitter uses for the user to follow who would be more likely to follow back. It would suggest a list of users to unfollow because they're not following back, and it would suggest a list of users to unfollow because they're following and tend to continue following, whether or whether not the users they follow follow-back.
* Scrapebook CMS
  * Create a scrapebook timecapsule where you create a vignette of data and get it emailed to you.
* Seasonal Ingredient Recipe Suggestor
  * Self-explanatory 

## Data Visualization
* Maps that show social program enrollment data, such as [Slate's article on food stamps](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/map_of_the_week/2013/04/food_stamp_recipients_by_county_an_interactive_tool_showing_local_snap_data.html) and [D3 visualization of food stamps by state](http://bl.ocks.org/NPashaP/a74faf20b492ad377312).


## Coding-Specific
* Gitabarotors
  * Show via commits who and through what projects you've worked on with people.
* Big O calculutor
  * Read more about Big-O Notation [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation).

## Logistics
* Food Truck Tracker
  * Based on foodtruck twitters, or other info, map foodtrucks.
* On My Way Too...
  * Find X type of place near a route.

## Flatiron Software
* Flatiron Magazine
  * Improve upon the current version of [Flatiron's Blog Magazine](http://magazine.flatironschool.com/)
* Flatiron Eats
  * Using the Yelp and Google Maps APIs allow the user to curate lists from Yelp.
  * Somehow have modal where the pin on the map would link to the Yelp link.
  * Incorporate comments from fellow students and teachers.
  * Would be hosted at `eat.flatironschool.com`.
* Flatiron Science Fair App
  * Login system, three roles: student, staff, hiring partner
  * Profiles for each student
  * Starring and comment system displayed only to hiring partners.
  * Form pages for students to fill out with their information/upload PDFs using an uploader GEM
  * Students can only edit their own page, staff can edit every page, vistors can only view/star/comment.
* Match Volunteer Tutors to Students
  * Uses locations, skill levels, preferences, availability to match tutors with students.
  * Could take the place of Elana's current weekend Google Drive spreadsheet system.
