# Web Development Project Mode Ideas

## Background
In terms of what projects are cool, we tend to think the nature of value in software lies in being able to answer or automate a question that was previously difficult. For example, Airbnb answers the questions "Who's couch can I crash on tonight?", Kickstarter "Where can I get money for an art project?" (or conversely, "Which independent projects can I support?"). Your application—every feature—should answer a person's question. For instance, an application you could build might answer, "Who is committing code at Flatiron School right now?", "Who wants to meet for tutoring this weekend?". Focus on questions, on problems, then solve them with code. Your application should answer at most 2-3 fundemental questions.

* Increase Your Twitter Following
  * Based on content of a user's tweets and the people who already follow that user, this software would recommend other Twitter uses for the user to follow who would be more likely to follow back. It would suggest a list of users to unfollow because they're not following back, and it would suggest a list of users to unfollow because they're following and tend to continue following, whether or whether not the users they follow follow-back.
